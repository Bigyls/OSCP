# OSCP Cheat Sheet  and Mind Map

This repository describes my notes and exploits I wrote while preparing for the OSCP. Based on Obsidian and the default plugin [canva](https://obsidian.md/canvas) the format of these notes allows for a visual and written overview combining Obsdian's advanced search capabilities.
