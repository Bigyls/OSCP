This includes open-source projects and online code repositories such as:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) ([GitHub's search](https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-code))
- [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/)
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/)

This manual approach will work best on small repos. For larger repos, we can use several tools to help automate some of the searching, such as [_Gitrob_](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob) and [_Gitleaks_](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks).. Most of these tools require an [access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) to use the source code-hosting provider's API.
