Successful SQL injection often requires a payload tailored to a specific SQL database system. Payload usability is indicated as follows:

- **M** = works on MySQL
- **S** = works on SQL Server
- **P** = works on PostgreSQL
- **O** = works on Oracle
- **L** = works on SQLite
- **+** = works on potentially other databases

When a payloads works on several database systems, you will see multiple symbols:

- **(MS)** = works on MySQL and SQL Server
- **(PO+)** = works on PostgreSQL, Oracle, and possibly other databases
