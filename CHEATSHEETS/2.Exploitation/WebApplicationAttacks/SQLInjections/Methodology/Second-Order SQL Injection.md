With a second-order SQL injection, your injected payload is stored somewhere by the application and then used somewhere, hopefully unfiltered because SQL injection wasn’t expected in that place. This is a common hidden layer problem.

Say you have an application that lets you create some kind of user account. You can try this injection into the name field:

Name: `' + (SELECT TOP 1 password FROM users ) + '`   
Email: `xx@xx.com`

With this payload, if the application uses the name field value in an unsafe stored procedure, function, or process, it will store the first user’s password as your name.
