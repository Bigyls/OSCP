An HTA is a proprietary Windows program whose source code consists of HTML and one or more scripting languages supported by Internet Explorer (VBScript and JScript). An HTA is executed using mshta.exe, which is typically installed along with IE. In fact, mshta is dependant on IE, so if it has been uninstalled, HTAs will be unable to execute.We can create a malicious hta file and use it on phishing.
